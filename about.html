            <p>
                To me, design is like a purposeful adventure, without maps. Constantly observing, thinking and communicating to harness this randomness.
                I value the consecutiveness between research and design, and love to explore and think about the influence and development of design and 
                social relations. I am currently studying for the master degree in social work and information at the University of Michigan, and assisting 
                in the production of While We Were Away podcast at Prison Creative Art Project as a social work intern.
